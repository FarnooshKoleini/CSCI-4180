## **1.Neo4j schema design and data load**

1.1 Schema design (20 pts)

Draw the database schema for the graph database, using http://www.apcjones.com/arrows. Include a screenshot of it. 

To create the schema for this dataset, first of all we can create a really general schema includes all main nodes and their relationship, then we can create the whole schema with all the details,nodes, and relationships. I uploaded the pdf file for the general schema called arrow schema (detail) in the zip file. Also, I uploaded the screenshot of the general schema, please find them.

1.2 Data load (30 pts)

# CREAT all the nodes

## **Data analysis (60 pts: 5 pts each per SQL query, 5 pts each per Cypher query)** 

Write the SQL queries and the Cypher queries to answer the following questions.

a) In which rooms does the course with Course number 1 takes place? Retrieve the course name and the names of the rooms in which the course takes place.

# SQL query

SELECT c.Course_Name, r.Room_Name
FROM Courses c
INNER JOIN Rooms r ON c.Room_ID = r.Room_ID
WHERE c.Course_Number = 1;

# cypher query

MATCH (c:Course {Course_Number: 1})-[:Takes_Place_In]->(r:Room)
RETURN c.Course_Name AS Course_Name, r.Room_Name AS Room_Name

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align = "center"}
 knitr::include_graphics("/Users/koleinif20/Desktop/big_data/Homework 3/2.png")
```


b) How many hours and in which projects does student with Student ID 1 works on? Retrieve the first name of the student, the project the student works on, and the corresponding num- ber of hours worked on the project.

# SQL query

SELECT s.First_Name, p.Project_Name, w.Hours
FROM Student s
JOIN Works_On w ON s.`Student_ID` = w.`Student_ID`
JOIN Project p ON w.Project_Number = p.Project_Number
WHERE s.`Student_ID` = 1;

# cypher query

MATCH (s:Student)-[w:Works_On]->(p:Project)
WHERE s.`Student_ID` = 1
RETURN s.First_Name, p.Project_Name, w.Hours

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align = "center"}
 knitr::include_graphics("/Users/koleinif20/Desktop/big_data/Homework 3/3.png")
```

c) Which students and how many hours do they work on the project with Project number 24? Retrieve the project name, the last name of the student, and the corresponding number of hours worked on the project.

# SQL query

SELECT p.Project_Name, s.Last_Name, w.Hours
FROM Project p
JOIN Works_On w ON p.Project_Number = w.Project_Number
JOIN Student s ON w.Student_ID = s.Student_ID
WHERE p.Project_Number = 24;

# cypher query

MATCH (s:Student)-[w:Works_On]->(p:Project {Project_Number: 24})
RETURN p.Project_Name, s.Last_Name, w.Hours

Or 

MATCH (s:Student)-[w:Works_On]->(p:Project)
WHERE p.Project_Number = 24
RETURN p.Project_Name, s.Last_Name, w.Hours

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align = "center"}
 knitr::include_graphics("/Users/koleinif20/Desktop/big_data/Homework 3/4.png")
```

d) Which students work in which projects and how many hours? Retrieve the last name of the students, the name of the projects they work on, and the corresponding number of hours. Order the results by the last name of the students. Limit the results to four.

# SQL query

SELECT s.last_name, p.project_name, w.hours
FROM works_on w
JOIN student s ON s.student_id = w.student_id
JOIN project p ON p.project_number = w.project_number
ORDER BY s.last_name
LIMIT 4;

# cypher query

MATCH (s:Student)-[w:Works_On]->(p:Project)
WHERE w.Hours IS NOT NULL
RETURN s.Last_Name, p.Project_Name, w.Hours
LIMIT 4

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align = "center"}
 knitr::include_graphics("/Users/koleinif20/Desktop/big_data/Homework 3/5.png")
```
e) Whichstudentsworkonmorethantwoprojectsandonhowmanyprojectsexactly?Retrieve the last name of the students and the corresponding number of projects. Order the results by the number of projects.

# SQL query

SELECT 
    students.Last_Name, 
    COUNT(*) AS num_projects 
FROM 
    works_on 
    INNER JOIN students ON works_on.Student_ID = students.Student_ID 
GROUP BY 
    works_on.Student_ID, students.Last_Name 
HAVING 
    COUNT(*) > 2 
ORDER BY 
    num_projects;
    
# cypher query

MATCH (s:Student)-[w:Works_On]->(p:Project)
WITH s, COUNT(p) as num_projects
WHERE num_projects > 2
RETURN s.Last_Name as Last_Name, num_projects
ORDER BY num_projects

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align = "center"}
 knitr::include_graphics("/Users/koleinif20/Desktop/big_data/Homework 3/6.png")
```

f) Which students have the same last name and work on the same projects? Retrieve the first name of the students and the name of projects they share.

# SQL query

SELECT s1.first_name, s2.first_name, p.project_name
FROM works_on w1
JOIN works_on w2 ON w1.project_number = w2.project_number AND w1.student_id < w2.student_id
JOIN student s1 ON s1.student_id = w1.student_id
JOIN student s2 ON s2.student_id = w2.student_id AND s1.last_name = s2.last_name
JOIN project p ON p.project_number = w1.project_number
ORDER BY s1.last_name, s2.last_name, p.project_name;

# cypher query

MATCH (s1:Student)-[w1:Works_On]->(p:Project)<-[w2:Works_On]-(s2:Student)
WHERE s1.Last_Name = s2.Last_Name AND w1.Hours = w2.Hours
RETURN s1.First_Name, p.Project_Name
